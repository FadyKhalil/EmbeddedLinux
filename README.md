# Embedded Linux Tutorial

This repository contains the necessary components to build an embedded Linux system from scratch, including libraries, tools, and custom configurations.

## Components

- **Crosstool-NG**: A toolchain generator for building cross-compiling toolchains.
- **U-Boot**: A boot loader used in embedded systems.
- **Kernel**: The Linux kernel for embedded systems.
- **BusyBox**: A collection of Unix utilities in a single executable for embedded systems.
- **Init Process**: The first process started during bootup, responsible for initializing the system.
- **Buildroot**: A tool that automates building embedded Linux systems.
- **Yocto**: A flexible build system for creating custom Linux distributions for embedded systems.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for building the system, such as `gcc`, `make`, and `libssl-dev`.
3. Choose the appropriate tool for building the system, such as Buildroot or Yocto.
4. Follow the instructions in the tool's documentation to configure and build the system.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a complete set of components for building an embedded Linux system, including libraries, tools, and custom configurations. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily build your own custom embedded Linux system.
